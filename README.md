# hello-world
This is my experimental starter site for info 101. 
I am a senior studying Visual Communication Design at the University of Washington. I am looking forward to this class because in the design industry, we help design websites and often work with coders. I am excited to learn more about coding and building a website so I am able to communicate better with a developer when working on a project.
